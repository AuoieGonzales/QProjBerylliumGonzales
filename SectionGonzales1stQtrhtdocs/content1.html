          <h2>2013-2014</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Coming from different hometowns, backgrounds and ages, Bighit debuted the seven with their first album “2 Cool 4 Skool”in 2013. Within these years, they released their first extended play “O!RUL8,2?”, a Japanese Album and their first studio album, “Dark & Wild”. From a company that almost got bankrupt, they all lived in a small apartment sharing one room. Each of the members worked very hard and is involved in writing and producing their songs. They started as a group with only a few fans. They used their managers’ personal stuff for props in their music videos to save money.  They practiced for 16 hours a day up until their bodies give up. They won a lot of  “new artist awards” from different shows, but they weren’t promoted well, since they came from a small unknown company. Since the start, there were a lot of people who didn’t believe in them, saying that it’s impossible for them to survive in the industry. Belittling them for wearing make up as it’s not acceptable to be called "hiphop". Music shows cut their performances and reduced their screen time. This is why BTS used  social media to make themselves known by those who weren’t aware that their group exists. They also used these platforms to connect with their fans and promote their music. They uploaded pictures, their blogs, and dance practice videos. They also created these accounts prior to their debut to gain attention, posting a diary-like video of the members. This technique helped them reach a wide range of audience and gain fans abroad.</p>

          <h2>2015</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Two years after debut, their hard work finally started to pay off. This year came the biggest turning point in their career. They tried a different music style. This earned them their first music show win on SBS “The Show” on May 5, 2015 with their song “I Need U’ in their album “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life”, followed by many more songs connected in a story line. Some of the lyrics of their songs also include problems of the society, opening the eyes of many to the sensitive topics of depression, mental health, inequalities, and a lot more which most artists in Korea do not dare to discuss about. BTS won against a big group, so people were suspicious and accused them of sajaegi. Sajaegi is when the company buying their own album to boost the release causing them to win this award. This was debunked when the Hanteo chart said that the sales were imputted all at once causing a sudden spike. Another thing is that the company they are in is pretty small and doesn’t have enough money to be capable of sajaegi.</p>

          <h2>2016: First Daesang</h2>
        </header>
        <p>On 2016, the members promoted on Korean variety shows. They were mistreated by the hosts of most of these variety programs. The fans called May 2016 the terror month because of the series of accusations and attacks thrown at the group. They were also suddenly cut from the Busan One Asia Festival’s broadcast. Even though that’s the case, they still performed without cameras and proper lighting for their fans who waited for them. At the last parts of the year happened another big turning point. On November 19, 2016, the group won their 1st Daesang on Melon Music Awards (MMA). Daesang is the highest achievement award a group can receive. Their 1st daesang is the Album of the Year with “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever”. December of the same year, the group won another daesang for the Artist of  the year award on Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA). Coming from a small company, a lot were shocked by this win and accused the show of miscalculations. </p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      </header>
      <p>BTS became popular worldwide, because they inspire others through their music in this digital world. They also helped a lot of their fans and led them to the way to loving and appreciating themselves, little by little. Not only that, but their awesome, well-made stages, great songs, touching lyrics, great team work, and fiery performances also attracted the attention of many from different age group, sexuality, and walks of life. They've encountered a lot of problems and obstacles , but were able to surpass them all together. They started at the bottom and worked hard on their way up. Despite the popularity the boys have stayed humble, true to themselves, and thankful to their fans from the beginning up to now. This is evident to the lyrics from their song “We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal” which is dedicated to their fans, “Even if I’m blocked off, I will still walk/We are, we are forever bulletproof/Yeah we are not seven, with you.”</p>
