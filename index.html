        <h2>BTS: We are Bulletproof</h2>
        <p>“If we can help you with your dream and your life a bit by our existence, our music, our performance, our pictures or videos, even if its not much. If we could reduce your pain from 100 to 99, 98 or 97, that makes our existence worthy.”, is a remark by Kim Namjoon better known as RM, the leader of the septet BTS at their ‘2017 BTS Trilogy III The Wings Tour The Final concert in Seoul.’ BTS is a 7-member full Korean boy group based in South Korea, under Bighit Music, formerly Bighit Entertainment. The name BTS is an abbreviation of the Korean term "Bangtan Sonyeondan" which translates to "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". The meaning of their name as explained on many interviews is "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets". BTS has a loyal fan base called the ARMYs. ARMY is an abbreviation for Adorable Representative MC for Youth. As ARMY can also mean people in military,the meaning behind it is that because BTS is bulletproof, they will always protect their fans and that they will always be together. Their fans support them by helping them break records, voting for them on award shows, trending them on social media accounts, buying their physical albums, organizing mass streaming events to boost their views and digital sales, and a whole lot more.</p>
