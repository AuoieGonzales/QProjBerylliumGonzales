          Sewol Ferry Disaster 416 Family Council:
        </header>
        <p id="a1">The sewol ferry disaster happened on April 16, 2014. The ferry sunk resulting to the death of 304 people, including staff and students. The students from Danwon High School were on their way to have a trip in Jeju Island when this incident happened. The media and the people in power tried to hide the truth about this because it was poorly handled and may cause damage to Korea’s reputation. It was believed that the passengers could’ve been saved. When the boat was sinking, the crew told the passengers to just stay put in their cabins. On the other hand, the captain and other officials had escaped. The passengers just obeyed the crews, but it costed them their lives.</p>

          Black Lives Matter:
        </header>
        <p>The Black Lives Matter movement or BLM spreads awareness about the discrimination and brutality that black people are experiencing in this society especially in the United States. On May of 2020, George Floyd, an African-American, was subjected to violence and murdered by police officers while getting arrested for suspected theft. This started the protests which fought against racism and police brutality.<br><br>BTS and their label made a donation of 1 million dollar for this movement on June of the same year. They also made a post about their support on the Black Lives Matter movement on their twitter account. According to Suga on their interview on Variety (2020): “Ours are initiatives that any person who wishes to live in a just world would want to pursue. We aren’t trying to send out some grandiose message.”. However, this inspired their fans, the ARMY, to match their donation raising over 1 million dollar for the campaign in less than 24 hours after BTS made theirs.</p>
